ngin3D Animation (for Movement of Actors, not artist-defined Actor animation).

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
ngin3D is an alternative to Android Animation as a method for changing the
properties of an Actor (position, rotation etc.) over time.
<p>
A key use of ngin3D animation is the loading and playing of animations
of 2D Actors in 3D space, authored in Adobe <i>After Effects</i>.
<h3>Important</h3>
ngin3d Animation is <b>not</b> the way that animated Actors designed
in 3ds Max or Blender are animated.
That animation is Glo3D Animation and is controlled by methods such as
myActor.play().
ngin3D animation affects the position, rotation, scaling of the Actor
as a whole, not the pre-defined animation within the Actor.
