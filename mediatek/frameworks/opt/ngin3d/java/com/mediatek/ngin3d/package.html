Main MAGE API containing most frequently used graphics classes.

<h3>Stage</h3>
<p>
The Stage is the environment in which the 3D graphics is created.
The key classes here are <b>Stage</b> and <b>Actor</b>.
Every object within a scene is an Actor.
<b>Container</b> is a special type of Actor that contains only
other Actors. The camera configuration is part of the Stage, but lights
are distinct objects of class <b>Light</b>.
<p>
The scene can be made up of multiple <b>Layers</b>.  This enables the creation
of User Interfaces where, for example, a 2D UI overlays a 3D scene with
a 2D background image.

<h3>Actors</h3>
The manipulation of Actors is via their <b>Property</b> values, including
position, rotation, scale etc.
Synchronising such changes can be done with <b>Transactions</b>.
<p>
Access to internal components of Actors created by Artists is provided by
<b>ActorNode</b>.

<h3>3D Maths</h3>
<p>
The core 3-dimensional maths types are <b>Point</b> (a scalar position in 3D)
and <b>Vec3</b>, a 3D vector with length and direction.
<p>
Transformation classes are <b>Scale</b> and <b>Rotation</b>.
<b>Quaternion</b> is provided for rotations.
<b>EulerOrder</b> is available when the sequence of Euler
rotations needs to be controlled.

<h3>Geometry</h3>
Simple 2D and 3D models are provided in <b>Plane, Image</b>
(Plane with texture), <b>Cube</b> and <b>Sphere</b>.
<p>
<b>Warning: </b>
these are designed only for use in UI_PERSPECTIVE mode where the Y
direction is down.  It is not expected that they are used in end-user
applications.  Artist 3D models will normally expect the conventional
Y-up PERSPECTIVE mode.
