<p>
MAGE is a software development kit for the creation of 3D graphics applications
and user interfaces on Android.

<p>
<b>ngin3D</b> is the user-facing part of MAGE.  It provides the integration between the user
applications, Android infrastructure including threading, interpreting JSON
animations generated by Adobe AfterEffects, and MediaTek's A3M 3D Graphics engine.

<p>
This diagram illustrates where ngin3D fits into MAGE.  MAGE also includes
MediaTek's A3M graphics engine and support for both Adobe AfterEffects for
animation, and Autodesk 3DSMax for animated 3D models and scenes.

<p>
<b>A3M</b> (Advanced 3D Middleware) is a compact and highly flexible 3D graphics engine
specifically designed for embedded environments.
A3M is not specfic to Android and may be deployed on other OS's and platforms
(for example, it is used in the Windows tool "Gloviewer").
