•	Text? Audio? Photos? And more!
iSMS enables you and your contacts to communicate with text messages instantly. Moreover, several types of emoticons are on your choice and messages of audio, photo, video, sketch, location, calendar, contacts are supported.

•	Single chat? Let’s chat together!
Send a message to one person, or invite several friends to chat together. Share your voice, photos, videos, locations and so on. The more people join in the group chat, the more messages there will be. No matter how large the message amount is, with iSMS, all of these are free. What are you waiting for? Go get your friends invited!

•	Spam！
iSMS provides a spam filter. You can mark any chat thread as spam. Thereafter, all messages from that number will be placed in spam list quietly. 

•	Message delivered? Yeah, already read it!
It’s reassuring to know your message was received — or even read. iSMS tells you if your message was delivered. If the recipient has “Show Read Status” enabled, you’ll see that your message was read, too.

•	Blue is best? Green is better!
When your text bubble is green instead of blue, you’ll know that you’re using iSMS instead of SMS, that the text session is free, that you can get a quicker response, that you can send more than just text, and that they have received the text, or read it.

•	So can I send SMS anyway?
Messages can be sent as SMS or MMS when iSMS is unavailable due to network issues or non-iSMS recipients; carrier messaging fees apply.
